    <string name="Dosage">
        <![CDATA[

								<h3>General dosage guidelines:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Treatment with Concor should be based on the individual patient, starting with a low dose and increasing it slowly and gradually.</li>
									<li>Concor should be taken once a day in the morning before or with breakfast. It should be swallowed whole with a little liquid.</li>
									<li>In general, Concor is a long-term treatment and should not be withdrawn suddenly, as this can lead to a temporary deterioration in the condition of the patient (particularly in patients with coronary heart disease). The dose should be reduced gradually.</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Specific dosage guidelines:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>1. Treatment of essential hypertension, angina associated with coronary heart disease and hyperkinetic heart syndrome:<br>
									The usual starting dose is 5 mg per day. In many cases, this is also adequate for long-term treatment and can be increased to 10 mg once a day if necessary.</li><br>
									<li>2. Treatment of stable chronic heart failure:<br>
										The treating doctor should have experience in managing chronic heart failure and the patient should be stable (without acute heart failure) when treatment with Concor starts. The treatment must start with a titration phase based on the dosing schedule described below. If tolerability is good, the patient can move up to the next dose.</li><br>
									<li>- Week 1: 1.25 mg (half a 2.5 mg tablet) once daily.<br>
										- Week 2: 2.5 mg (one 2.5 mg tablet) once daily.<br>
										- Week 3: 3.75 mg (one and a half 2.5 mg tablets) once daily.<br>
										- Weeks 4-7: 5 mg (one 5 mg tablet) once daily.<br>
										- Weeks 8-11: 7.5 mg (one and a half 5 mg tablets) once daily.<br>
										- From week 12: 10 mg (one 10 mg tablet) once daily as maintenance treatment.<br><br>
									</li>
									<li>The maximum recommended dose is 10 mg once daily.
										During the titration phase, close monitoring of the patient (heart rate, blood pressure) is recommended and it is important to watch for signs of worsening heart failure.
										If the patient does not tolerate an increase in the dose or the maximum recommended dose well, a gradual reduction in the dose can be considered and the treatment continued with a lower dose. If heart failure worsens temporarily, or if the patient develops hypotension or bradycardia, a check on the dose of concomitant medication is recommended. If necessary, the bisoprolol dose can also be reduced temporarily or the treatment withdrawn. Once the patient has stabilized, consideration should be given to resuming the treatment or increasing the bisoprolol dose.
									</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Dosage In Specific Clinical Situations</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>1. Patients with kidney or liver failure:</li>
									<li>Treatment of essential hypertension or angina pectoris:<br>
										The dose does not need to be adjusted for patients with mild or moderate kidney or liver failure. In patients with severely impaired kidney (creatinine clearance &#60; 20 ml/min) or liver function, a daily dose of 10 mg should not be exceeded. Experience of bisoprolol in the treatment of dialysis patients is limited. In spite of this, the dose does not need to be adjusted.</li>
									<li>Treatment of stable chronic heart failure:
										There are no pharmacokinetic data for patients with kidney or liver failure. Therefore, the dose must be increased very carefully.</li><br>
									<li>2. Elderly patients:</li>
									<li>The dose does not need to be adjusted.</li><br>
									<li>3. Children and adolescents:</li>
									<li>There are no pediatric data for Concor. For this reason, Concor is not recommended for patients under 18 years of age.</li>

    <string name="Contraindications">
        <![CDATA[

                	<h3>1. Contraindication:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>- Acute heart failure and episodes of congestive heart failure requiring parenteral inotropic therapy.</li>
									<li>- Second or third degree AV block (without a pacemaker).</li>
									<li>- Sick sinus syndrome.</li>
									<li>- Sinoatrial block.</li>
									<li>- Cardiogenic shock.</li>
									<li>- Symptomatic bradycardia with fewer than 60 beats per minute before treatment starts.</li>
									<li>- Symptomatic hypotension (systolic blood pressure &#60; 100 mmHg).</li>
									<li>- Severe form of peripheral arterial occlusive disease or Raynaud\'s syndrome.</li>
									<li>- Severe bronchial asthma.</li>
									<li>- Untreated phaeochromocytoma.</li>
									<li>- Metabolic acidosis.</li>
									<li>- Hypersensitivity to bisoprolol or to any of the excipients according to the composition.</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>2. Interactions</h3>
								<p>Concomitant use of the following is not recommended:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>- Calcium antagonists of the verapamil and, to a lesser extent, diltiazem type: negative effect on contractility and AV conduction. Intravenous administration of verapamil may lead to marked hypotension and AV block.</li><br>
									<li>- Centrally acting antihypertensives (e.g. reserpine, Î±-methyldopa, clonidine, moxonidine): The hypotensive effect is intensified by the reduction in heart rate and cardiac output, and by vasodilation. Sudden withdrawal of a centrally acting antihypertensive, particularly before withdrawing Î²-blocker treatment, may increase the risk of rebound hypertension.</li><br>
									<li>- Class I anti-arrhythmics (e.g. quinidine, lidocaine, phenytoin) in patients with chronic heart failure: They may increase the effect on AV conduction time and the negative inotropic effect of Î²-receptor blockers.</li><br>
								</ul>
								<p>Caution must be exercised during concomitant use of the following:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>- Insulin and oral antidiabetics: intensification of the hypoglycemic effect. The warning signs of hypoglycemia (e.g. tachycardia, palpitations or sweating) may be masked or reduced by Î²- blockers.</li><br>
									<li>- Calcium antagonists of the dihydropyridine type (e.g. nifedipine, felodipine, amlodipine): There may be an increased risk of hypotension and ventricular pump function may be deteriorated in patients with heart failure.</li><br>
									<li>- Class III anti-arrhythmics (e.g. amiodarone): possible intensification of the effect on AV conduction time.</li><br>
									<li>- Cholinergic agonists: AV conduction time may be prolonged and there may be an increased risk of bradycardia.</li><br>
									<li>- Anaesthetics: attenuation of reflex tachycardia and an increased risk of hypotension.</li><br>
									<li>- Digitalis glycosides: an increase in AV conduction time, which slows down the heart rate.</li><br>
									<li>- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): The hypotensive effect may be reduced.</li><br>
									<li>- Î²-agonists (e.g. dobutamine): The effect of both substances may be reduced.
									<li>- Agonists that activate Î±- and Î²-receptors (e.g. adrenaline, noradrenaline): a possible increase in blood pressure and exacerbation of intermittent claudication. Such interaction is particularly likely to occur with non-selective Î²-blockers.</li><br>
									<li>- Other antihypertensives or medicinal products with hypotensive properties (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, barbiturates and phenothiazines), including eye drops used to treat glaucoma and alcohol: There is an increased risk of hypotension.</li><br>
									<li>- Class I anti-arrhythmics (e.g. quinidine, lidocaine, phenytoin) in patients with essential hypertension or angina: They may increase the effect on AV conduction time and the negative inotropic effect of Î²-receptor blockers.</li>
								</ul>
								<p><em>- If any of the following are used concomitantly, please note:</em></p>
								<ul>
									<li>- Mefloquine: increased risk of bradycardia.</li>
									<li>- Monoamine oxidase inhibitors (excluding MAO-B inhibitors): increase in the hypotensive effect of the Î²-blocker, but also a risk of hypertensive crisis.</li>
									<li>- Ergotamine derivatives: exacerbation of peripheral circulatory disorders.</li>
								</ul>

    <string name="Warnings">
        <![CDATA[
                <h3>1. Warnings</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>- Patients with coronary heart disease should not stop taking Concor suddenly unless absolutely necessary, as this may lead to a temporary deterioration in their condition</li>
									<li>- Treatment of stable chronic heart failure must commence with a titration phase (see Specific dosage guidelines).</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>2. Precautions:</h3>
								<p>Bisoprolol must be used with caution in cases of:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>- Diabetes mellitus with large fluctuations in blood glucose: The risk of affecting carbohydrate metabolism or masking symptoms of hypoglycemia (tachycardia, palpitations or sweating) is lower with Î²1-receptor blockers than with non-selective Î²-receptor blockers. In spite of this, caution is advised.</li><br>
									<li>- Strict fasting.</li><br>
									<li>- Concomitant desensitization therapy: Like all Î²-blockers, bisoprolol may increase sensitivity to allergens, which can increase the severity of anaphylactic reactions. Treatment with adrenaline does not always have the desired effect.</li><br>
									<li>- First degree AV block.</li><br>
									<li>- Prinzmetal\'s angina.</li><br>
									<li>- Peripheral arterial occlusive disease: The symptoms may intensify, particularly at the  start of treatment.</li><br>
									<li>- Psoriasis or a history of psoriasis: Î²-blockers (e.g. bisoprolol) should not be used until a careful risk-benefit analysis has taken place.</li><br>
									<li>- Thyrotoxicosis: The symptoms of thyrotoxicosis may be masked by bisoprolol.</li><br>
									<li>- Anaesthesia: The anesthetist must be informed about treatment with Concor before anaesthesia is induced because of potential interactions with other medicinal products. If it is necessary to suspend the treatment, the dose should be reduced gradually and Concor withdrawn no later than 48 hours before anaesthesia is induced.</li><br>
									<li>- chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): Due to its relative Î²1-selectivity, Concor may be used with caution in patients with COPD if there are compelling clinical reasons for its use. In this case, the treatment with bisoprolol should be started at the lowest possible dose. Concomitant treatment with a bronchodilator should be administered.</li><br>
									<li>- Bronchial asthma: Concomitant treatment with a bronchodilator should be administered. Occasionally, airway resistance may increase in patients with asthma, requiring an increase in the Î²2-agonist dose; in cases of severe bronchial asthma, Concor is contraindicated (see Contraindications).</li><br>
									<li>- Phaeochromocytoma: Bisoprolol must not be administered until after Î±-receptor blockade.</li><br>
									<li>- Essential hypertension or angina and heart failure.</li><br>
									<li>- At the start of treatment with Concor for stable chronic heart failure, the patient must be monitored regularly (see Specific dosage guidelines).</li><br>
								</ul>
								<p>Concor should be used with caution in patients with heart failure who are also in one of the following clinical situations, as there is no therapeutic experience of these combinations:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>- Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (type 1).</li>
									<li>- Severely impaired kidney function.</li>
									<li>- Severely impaired liver function.</li>
									<li>- Restrictive cardiomyopathy.</li>
									<li>- Congenital heart disease.</li>
									<li>- Heart valve defects with hemodynamic effects.</li>
									<li>- Myocardial infarction in the previous 3 months.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Ending the treatment:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Â Treatment with bisoprolol should not be withdrawn suddenly, as this may lead to temporary worsening of heart failure or, especially in patients with coronary heart disease, an acute deterioration in their condition. If it is necessary to withdraw the treatment, the dose should be reduced gradually (e.g. halved at weekly intervals).</li>

    <string name="Pregnancy">
        <![CDATA[

								<h3>1. Pregnancy</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>- The pharmacological effects of bisoprolol may have a negative impact on pregnancy and/or the foetus/newborn infant. Î²-blockers reduce placental perfusion, which is associated with growth retardation, intrauterine death, abortion or preterm delivery. Undesirable effects (e.g. hypoglycemia and bradycardia) may occur in the foetus/newborn infant. If treatment with Î²-blockers is necessary, Î²1- selective receptor blockers should be used.
									</li>
									<li>Concor should not be used during pregnancy unless absolutely necessary. If it is considered necessary, uteroplacental blood flow and foetal growth must be monitored closely. If it has negative effects on the pregnancy or the foetus, other treatment options should be considered. The neonate must be monitored carefully for hypoglycemia or bradycardia for the first 3 days of life.</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>2. Lactation</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>The excretion of bisoprolol into the milk of breastfeeding women has not yet been determined directly. In an animal study, no more than 2% of a dose was found in milk. Concor should not be used during lactation.</li>

    <string name="Overdose">
        <![CDATA[
                   <h3>A Î²-blocker overdose can cause a drop in blood pressure, bradycardia, bronchospasm, acute heart failure, and hypoglycemia. The response to administration of a single high dose of bisoprolol shows great inter-subject variability, and patients with heart failure probably show a particularly sensitive response. After an acute overdose, treatment with Concor should be suspended, and supportive and symptomatic measures are recommended. The few data that are available suggest that bisoprolol is hardly dialyzable. If bradycardia occurs, 0.5-2.0 mg atropine sulphate is administered intravenously as an antidote. If an adequate increase in heart rate is not achieved, orciprenaline may also be administered.</h3>

        <![CDATA[
                  <h3>Mechanism Of Action / Pharmacodynamics:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>- Bisoprolol is a selective Î²1-receptor blocker and has neither intrinsic sympathomimetic nor relevant membrane-stabilizing properties. This high affinity for Î²1-receptors is accompanied by low affinity for Î²2-receptors in the smooth muscle of the bronchi and vessels as well as the Î²2-receptors involved in metabolic regulation. For this reason, bisoprolol is not expected to have an effect on airway resistance or Î²2-dependent metabolism in patients with heart failure, at least at low doses. Its Î²1-selectivity is maintained over the entire therapeutic dose range. Bisoprolol has no negative inotropic effects during long-term use.</li><br>
									<li>- The selective blockade of Î²1-receptors and the sympathetic nervous system reduces cardiac output and lowers blood pressure.</li>
									<li>- During long-term treatment, the initially elevated peripheral resistance falls. By blocking cardioselective Î²1-receptors, bisoprolol reduces responsiveness to adrenergic stimuli.</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Clinical Efficacy:</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>- Clinical studies of heart failure patients have shown that administration of bisoprolol in combination with a diuretic and an ACE inhibitor significantly reduces the mortality rate. Two heart failure studies (CIBIS I and CIBIS II), in which bisoprolol was administered in combination with diuretics and ACE inhibitors, showed that it had a beneficial effect on survival: while the 20% reduction in mortality seen in the first CIBIS study (n = 641 patients, of whom 320 took bisoprolol) was not significant, CIBIS II (n = 2647 patients, of whom 1327 took bisoprolol) showed a highly significant reduction in overall mortality in NYHA III/IV patients (11.8% of bisoprolol patients compared to 17.3% in the placebo group; relative reduction: 34%). There was also a clear decrease in cases of sudden cardiac death (3.6% compared to 6.3%; relative reduction: 44%) and the number of admissions to hospital because of worsening heart failure (12% compared to 17.6%; relative reduction: 36%). Finally, there was evidence of a significant improvement in cardiac function based on the NYHA classification.</li><br>

									<li>- The condition of the patients, who were assigned to only classes III and IV at baseline, improved so much during the study that 25.6% were in NYHA class II after 6 months. This figure rose to 32.3% after 12 months and 35.1% after 18 months. 1.7%, 2.8% and 3.3% were in NYHA class I after 6 months, 12 months and 18 months respectively. At 15%, the proportion of patients who stopped taking bisoprolol permanently was similar to that recorded for the placebo.</li><br>

									<li>- A study of 36 patients with coronary heart disease (but not chronic heart failure) showed that bisoprolol reduces the heart rate and rate-pressure product, thereby relieving the heart.</li><br>

									<li>- The CIBIS III study was conducted on 1010 patients aged 65 and over with mild to moderate chronic heart failure (NYHA classes II or III) and a left ventricular ejection fraction of â¤ 35%. The patients had not been treated with ACE inhibitors, Î²-blockers or angiotensin receptor blockers previously. This study compared the efficacy and safety of treatment starting with six months of bisoprolol (target dose 10 mg once daily), followed by additional administration of the ACE inhibitor enalapril (target dose 10 mg twice daily) for an additional 6-24 months, with those of treatment starting with enalapril, followed by additional administration of bisoprolol. There were 505 patients in each treatment group. The two treatment strategies were analyzed in a blinded fashion for both the combined primary endpoint - all-cause mortality or hospitalization - and the individual components. The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis showed that a primary endpoint event occurred in 178 patients in the group that started with bisoprolol (35.2%) and in 186 patients in the group that started with enalapril (36.8%). Therefore, the efficacy of treatment that starts with bisoprolol and adds enalapril is comparable (non-inferior) to that of the same combination administered in reverse order. 65 of the patients who started with bisoprolol died and 73 of the patients who started with enalapril died (difference between the groups: p = 0.44).</li><br>

									<li>- 151 of the patients who started with bisoprolol were admitted to hospital and 157 of the patients who started with enalapril were admitted to hospital (p = 0.66). The number of serious adverse events and the total number of adverse events were similar between the two groups. An analysis of the data from the first year of the study showed a 31% reduction in all-cause mortality in the group that started with bisoprolol compared to the group that started with enalapril. This trend was not significant. The survival benefit in the group that started with bisoprolol is attributed mainly to a 46% reduction in the risk of sudden cardiac death (p = 0.049) in the first year of treatment.</li><br>

    <string name="Pharmacokinetics">
        <![CDATA[
                  <h3>Absorption</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Bisoprolol is rapidly and almost completely (> 90%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and has only a small first-pass effect (&lt;10%). Plasma levels peak approx. 2-3 hours after oral administration. Bioavailability is high (approx. 90%) and does not depend on food intake. Kinetics are linear in a dose range from 5-20 mg.</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Distribution</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Plasma protein binding of bisoprolol is approximately 30%.Â </li>
									<li>As a moderately lipophilic substance with a partition coefficient of 4.8, bisoprolol has a moderate volume of distribution with low plasma protein binding. After intravenous administration of bisoprolol, the volume of distribution was measured as 3.2 Â± 0.2 l/kg BW. This shows that the pharmacokinetics of bisoprolol are independent of protein binding. Pharmacokinetic interactions with other medicinal products based on displacement from plasma protein binding sites are unlikely.</li>
									<li>Bisoprolol penetrates the blood-brain barrier and cerebrospinal fluid levels are assumed to be  similar to free unbound plasma levels. It can be concluded from animal studies that accumulation of bisoprolol in the CNS is low compared to accumulation in plasma (factor of 2). Only small amounts of bisoprolol penetrate the placental barrier in animals. As a result, f oetal concentrations are lower than maternal plasma concentrations. The excretion of bisoprolol into the milk of breastfeeding women has not yet been determined directly. In an animal study, no more than 2% of a dose was found in milk.</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Metabolism</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Bisoprolol is eliminated by two routes (liver and kidneys) equally. 50% is converted to inactive metabolites in the liver, which are then excreted by the kidneys.</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Elimination</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Â The remaining 50% is excreted by the kidneys as unchanged drug. The mean plasma elimination half-life of bisoprolol is 10-12 hours.</li>
								</ul>
								<h3>Kinetics In Special Patient Populations</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Â In patients with kidney failure, the elimination half-life of bisoprolol was increased by a factor of no more than 2. The same was found for patients with cirrhosis of the liver of varying severity. Adjustment of the bisoprolol dose is therefore only advisable for patients with end-stage kidney (creatinine clearance &lt;	20 ml/min) or liver failure. For these patients, a daily dose of 10 mg should not be exceeded.</li>
									<li>For patients with heart failure, no pharmacokinetic data are available.</li>
								</ul>

    <string name="Preclinical">
        <![CDATA[

								<p>- In studies on rats, bisoprolol had no effect on fertility or general ability to reproduce. Like other Î²-receptor blockers, bisoprolol had maternotoxic and fetotoxic/embryotoxic effects in rats and rabbits at high doses that were equivalent to many times (85 to 1400 times) the human therapeutic dose. Bisoprolol had no teratogenic effects at any of the doses administered in these studies.</p>
								<p>- In the teratogenicity/embryotoxicity tests (segment II), rats were given up to 150 mg/kg and rabbits up to 50 mg/kg.</p>
								<p>- In rats, bisoprolol produced mild fetotoxicity from doses of 50 mg/kg (350 to 1400 times the human therapeutic dose) (an increase in the number of late resorptions) and slight maternal toxicity at a dose of 150 mg/kg (1050 to 4150 times the human therapeutic dose) (reduction in food intake and weight gain). Rabbits tolerated doses of up to and including 6.25 mg/kg (45 to 175 times the human therapeutic dose) without toxic effects. Doses of 12.5 mg/kg and 50 mg/kg (85 to 1400 times the human therapeutic dose) were fetotoxic (an increase in the number of early resorptions).</p>
								<p>- Genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies found no specific risks.</p>

								</ul>
								<h3>2. Properties</h3>
								<ul>
									<li>Â Bisoprolol is a highly selective Ã1-adrenoceptor blocking agent with no intrinsic sympathomimetic activity and without significant membrane-stabilising activity.</li>
									<li>Â Hydrochlorothiazide is a thiazide diuretic with antihypertensive activity. Its diuretic effect is due to inhibition of active Na+ transport from the renal tubules to the blood, affecting Na+ reabsorption.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Pharmakokinetics of Bisoprolol</p>
								<ul>
									<li>Bisoprolol is absorbed almost completely (>90 %) from the gastrointestinal tract. Together with the very small first pass effect in the liver (&lt; 10%) this results in a absolute bioavailability of 88 %. The plasma protein binding of bisoprolol is about 30 %, its distribution volume being 226 Â± 11 l (x Â± SEM)</li>
									<li>Peak plasma concentrations are usually measured after 1-3 hours after administration. </li>
									<li>Â Bisoprolol is removed from the organism via two equally effective clearance routes: half of it is transformed into inactive metabolites in the liver with excretion of the metabolites via the kidneys, and half are excreted as unchanged substance via the kidneys. The plasma elimination half-life is 10-12 hours. The Cmax and AUC-values of bisoprolol in the steady state are bioequivalent in the fixed combination with hydrochlorothiazide and in the mono preparation.</li>
								</ul>
								<p>Pharmakokinetics of Hydrochlorothiazide</p>
								<ul>
									<li>After oral administration about 80Â % of hydrochlorothiazide is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract. The systemic availability is 71 Â± 15Â %.</li>
									<li>Â The plasma protein binding of hydrochlorothiazide is 64Â %; the relative volume of distribution is 0.5-1.1 l/kg.</li>
									<li>Â In healthy humans more than 95Â % of hydrochlorothiazide is excreted via the kidneys as unchanged substance.</li>
									<li>Â With normal kidney function the elimination half-life is 2.5 hours. Peak plasma concentrations are usually measured after 2-5 hours. This period increases in the presence of impaired kidney function and is about 20 hours in patients with terminal renal insufficiency.</li>
									<li>Â The diuretic effect sets in within 1-2 hours and lasts for 10-12 hours depending on the dose; the antihypertensive effect lasts for up to 24 hours.</li>

									<li>- Gout</li><br>
								</ul>
								<p>Interactions:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>- The effect and tolerability of medicines can be influenced by simultaneous intake of other medication. Such interactions can also occur if a short time has elapsed since the use of the other medication. Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.</li><br>
								</ul>
								<p>Combinations not recommended:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>- Lithium has a cardiotoxic and neurotoxic effect. This effect may be intensified through hydrochlorothiazide because it may lead to a reduction of lithium excretion. </li><br>
									<li>- Calcium antagonists of the verapamil type and to a lesser extent of the diltiazem type may lead to reduced contractility of the heart muscle and delayed atrio-ventricular impulse conduction when used concomitantly with bisoprolol. Especially intravenous administration of verapamil in patients on Ã-blocker treatment may lead to profound hypotension and atrioventricular block.</li><br>
									<li>- Centrally acting blood pressure-lowering medicines (such as clonidine, methyldopa, moxonodine, rilmenidine) may lead to a reduction of heart rate and cardiac output, as well as to vasodilation due to a decrease in the central sympathetic tonus. However do not stop taking these medicines without checking with your doctor first. This is because abrupt withdrawal, particularly if prior to beta-blocker discontinuation, may increase risk of ârebound hypertensionâ.</li><br>
								</ul>
								<p>Combinations to be used with caution:</p>
								<ul>
									<li>- Calcium antagonists of the dihydropyridine type (e.g. nifedipine) may increase the risk of hypotension when used concomitantly with bisoprolol. An increased risk of a further deterioration of the ventricular pump function in patients with heart failure cannot be excluded.</li><br>
									<li>- Class-I antiarrhythmic medicines (e.g. quinidine, disopyramide, lidocaine, phenytoin; flecainide, propafenone) may increase the depressant effect of bisoprolol on atrio-ventricular impulse conduction and the contractility of the heart.</li><br>
									<li>- ACE inhibitors (e.g. captopril, enalapril) or angiotensin II antagonists bear the risk of significant fall in blood pressure and/or acute renal failure during initiation of ACE inhibitor therapy in patients with pre-existing sodium depletion (particularly in patients with renal artery stenosis).</li><br>
									<li>- If prior diuretic therapy has produced sodium depletion, your doctor will either stop the diuretic 3Â days before starting ACE inhibitor therapy, or initiate ACE inhibitor therapy at a low dose.</li><br>
									<li>- Topical Ã-blockers (e.g. eye drops for glaucoma treatment) may add to the systemic effects of bisoprolol.</li><br>
									<li>Â Topical Ã-blockers (e.g. eye drops for glaucoma treatment) may add to the systemic effects of bisoprolol.</li><br>
									<li>- The blood sugar lowering effect of insulin or oral antidiabetic medicines may be intensified. Warning signs of reduced blood glucose (hypoglycaemia) â especially accelerated heart rate (tachycardia)- may be masked or suppressed. Such interactions are considered to be more likely with nonselective -blockers.</li><br>
									<li>- Anaesthetic agents may increase the risk of cardiodepressive actions of bisoprolol, leading to hypotension (for further information on general anaesthesia see also section special warnings and precautions)</li>
									<li>- Antiarrhythmic agents that may induce torsades de pointes (Class IA e.g. quinidine, hydroquinidine, disopyramide, and Class III e.g. amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide, ibutilide): Hypokalaemia may facilitate the occurrence of torsades de pointes.</li><br>
									<li>- Nonantiarrhythmic agents that may induce torsades de pointes (e.g. astemizole, i.v. erythromycin, halofantrine, pentamidine, sparfloxacin, terfenadine, vincamine.): Hypokalaemia may facilitate the occurrence of torsades de pointes.</li><br>
									<li>- Cardiac glycosides (digitalis) may lead to an increase in impulse conduction time and thus reduction in heart rate when used concomitantly with bisoprolol.</li><br>
									<li>- Toxic effects of cardiac glycosides (digitalis) may be facilitated if hydrochlorothiazide leads to hypokalaemia.</li><br>
									<li>- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) may reduce the blood pressure-lowering effect of Concor Plus. They also can trigger acute renal failure in patients developing hypovolaemia..</li><br>
									<li>- Sympathomimetics (e.g. isoprenaline, dobutamine) used in combination with bisoprolol may lead to a reduced effect of both agents.</li><br>
									<li>- A combination of bisoprolol with sympathomimetics that activate both - and -adrenoceptors (e.g. noradrenaline, adrenaline) may intensify the -adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstrictor effects of these agents leading to blood pressure increase. Such interactions are considered to be more likely with nonselective -blockers.</li><br>
									<li>- Antihypertensive agents as well as other medicines with blood pressure lowering potential (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, barbiturates, phenothiazines) may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of Concor Plus.</li><br>
									<li>- Potassium-wasting medicinal products (e.g. corticosteroids, ACTH, carbenoxolone, amphotericin B, furosemide, or laxatives) may result in increased potassium losses when used concomitantly with hydrochlorothiazide.</li><br>
									<li>- Methyldopa has been described in isolated cases to lead to haemolysis due to the formation of antibodies to hydrochlorothiazide.</li><br>
									<li>- The effect of uric-acid-lowering agents may be attenuated in concomitant administration of hydrochlorothiazide. </li><br>
									<li>- Cholestyramine and colestipol reduce the absorption of the hydrochlorothiazide.</li><br>
								</ul>
								<p>Combinations to be considered</p>
								<ul>
									<li>- Mefloquine may increase the risk of decelerating the heart rate (bradycardia), if used in combination with bisoprolol.</li><br>

								<h5>Â Treatment with bisoprolol must not be stopped suddenly unless clearly indicated, since abrupt withdrawal of bisoprolol may lead to an acute worsening of the patient\'s condition in particular in patients with ischaemic heart disease (see Dosage and Administration).</h5>
								<p>The following section describes when Concor Plus must be used with special caution (e.g. additional treatment or more frequent checks):</p>
								<ul>
									<li>- Any heart disease such as heart failure, mild disturbances in heart rhythm (first degree AV block), or disturbed blood flow in the coronary vessels due to vasospasms (Prinzmetalâs angina).</li><br>
									<li>- Peripheral arterial occlusive disease (intensification of complaints may occur especially when starting therapy).</li><br>
									<li>- Liver problems.</li><br>
									<li>- Diabetes mellitus with extremely fluctuating blood glucose levels: symptoms of markedly reduced blood glucose (hypoglycaemia) such as tachycardia, palpitations or sweating can be masked.</li><br>
									<li>- Psoriasis experienced currently or in the past.</li><br>
									<li>- Strict fasting</li><br>
									<li>Hyperuricaemia, as hydrochlorothiazide may enhance the risk for gout attacks.</li><br>
									<li>- Hypovolaemia.</li><br>
									<li>- Respiratory system: Although cardioselective (beta 1) beta-blockers may have less effect on lung function than non- selective beta-blockers, as with all beta-blockers, these should be avoided in patients with obstructive airway diseases, unless there are compelling clinical reasons for their use. Where such reasons exist, Concor plus may be used with caution. In bronchial asthma or other symptomatic chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases concomitant bronchodilator therapy is indicated. An increase in airway resistance may occasionally occur in patients with asthma, requiring a higher dose of beta2âsympathomimetics.</li><br>
									<li>- Allergic reactions: As with other beta-blockers, bisoprolol may increase both the sensitivity towards allergens and the severity of anaphylactic reactions. This also applies to desensitisation therapy. Epinephrine treatment may not always yield the expected therapeutic effect.</li><br>
									<li>- General anaesthesia: In patients undergoing general anaesthesia the anaesthetist must be aware of beta-blockade. If it is thought necessary to withdraw Concor Plus before surgery, this should be done gradually and completed about 48 hours prior to anaesthesia.</li><br>
									<li>- Phaeochromocytoma: In patients with a tumour of the adrenal gland (phaeochromocytoma) Concor Plus may only be administered after previous alpha-receptor blockade.</li><br>
									<li>- Thyrotoxicosis: Under treatment with Concor Plus the symptoms of a thyroid hyperfunction (thyrotoxicosis) may be masked.</li><br>
									<li>- Photosensitivity reactions may occur with thiazide diuretics. If photosensitivity reactions occur, it is recommended to protect exposed areas to the sun or to artificial UVA light. In severe cases it may be necessary to stop the treatment.</li><br>
									<li>- Long-term, continuous administration of hydrochlorothiazide may lead to fluid and electrolyte disturbances, in particular to hypokalaemia and hyponatraemia, also to hypomagnesaemia and hypochloraemia, and hypercalcaemia. Hypokalaemia facilitates the development of severe arrhythmias, particularly torsade de pointes, which may be fatal.</li><br>
									<li>During long term-therapy with hydrochlorothiazide, monitoring of serum electrolytes (especially potassium, sodium, calcium), creatinine and urea, the serum lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides), uric acid as well as blood glucose is recommended.</li><br>
									<li>Hydrochlorothiazide, a sulfonamide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in acute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy.</li><br>
								</ul>
								<h5>Â Pregnancy, Lactation and Fertility:</h5>
								<ul>
									<li>- Concor Plus is not recommended during pregnancy. Diuretics may give rise to foetoplacental ischaemia with the attendant risk of foetal hypotrophy. Hydrochlorothiazide is suspected to cause thrombocytopenia in the neonate.</li><br>
									<li>- Concor Plus is not recommended in breastfeeding women, because bisoprolol may be and hydrochlorothiazide is excreted in breast milk in minimal amounts. Hydrochlorothiazide can inhibit the milk production.</li><br>
								</ul>
								<h5>Fertility:</h5>
								<ul>
									<li>- No human data on fertility are known for the combination product. Bisoprolol or hydrochlorothiazide had no influence on fertility or on general reproduction performance in animal studies.</li>
								</ul>
								<h5>Effects On The Ability To Drive And Use Machines:</h5>
								<ul>
									<li>- In general Concor Plus has no or neglible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However, depending on the individual patients response to treatment the ability to drive a vehicle or to use machines may be impaired. This needs to be considered particularly at start of treatment, upon change of medication, or in conjunction with alcohol.</li><br>

								<p>In the case of suspected Concor Plus overdose please inform your doctor immediately. Depending on the degree of overdose your doctor can then decide which measures to take.</p><br>
								<h5>Symptoms:</h5>
								<ul>
									<li>- The most frequent signs of bisoprolol overdose include slow heart rate (bradycardia), marked drop in blood pressure (hypotension), acute heart failure, hypoglycaemia and bronchospasm. The clinical picture in acute or chronic overdose of hydrochlorothiazide is characterised by the extent of fluid and electrolyte loss. Most common signs are dizziness, nausea, somnolence, hypovolaemia, hypotension, hypokalaemia.</li>
								</ul>
								<h5>Management:</h5>
								<ul>
									<li>- In general, if overdose occurs, discontinuation of Concor Plus and supportive and symptomatic treatment is recommended.</li>
									<li>- Limited data suggest that bisoprolol is hardly dialysable. The degree to which hydrochlorothiazide is removed by haemodialysis has not been established.</li><br>
