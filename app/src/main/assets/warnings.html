                            <h4> Treatment with bisoprolol must not be stopped suddenly unless clearly indicated, since abrupt withdrawal of bisoprolol may lead to an acute worsening of the patient's condition in particular in patients with ischaemic heart disease (see Dosage and Administration).</h4>
                            <p>The following section describes when Concor Plus must be used with special caution (e.g. additional treatment or more frequent checks):</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>- Any heart disease such as heart failure, mild disturbances in heart rhythm (first degree AV block), or disturbed blood flow in the coronary vessels due to vasospasms (Prinzmetal’s angina).</li><br>
                                <li>- Peripheral arterial occlusive disease (intensification of complaints may occur especially when starting therapy).</li><br>
                                <li>- Liver problems.</li><br>
                                <li>- Diabetes mellitus with extremely fluctuating blood glucose levels: symptoms of markedly reduced blood glucose (hypoglycaemia) such as tachycardia, palpitations or sweating can be masked.</li><br>
                                <li>- Psoriasis experienced currently or in the past.</li><br>
                                <li>- Strict fasting</li><br>
                                <li>Hyperuricaemia, as hydrochlorothiazide may enhance the risk for gout attacks.</li><br>
                                <li>- Hypovolaemia.</li><br>
                                <li>- Respiratory system: Although cardioselective (beta 1) beta-blockers may have less effect on lung function than non- selective beta-blockers, as with all beta-blockers, these should be avoided in patients with obstructive airway diseases, unless there are compelling clinical reasons for their use. Where such reasons exist, Concor plus may be used with caution. In bronchial asthma or other symptomatic chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases concomitant bronchodilator therapy is indicated. An increase in airway resistance may occasionally occur in patients with asthma, requiring a higher dose of beta2–sympathomimetics.</li><br>
                                <li>- Allergic reactions: As with other beta-blockers, bisoprolol may increase both the sensitivity towards allergens and the severity of anaphylactic reactions. This also applies to desensitisation therapy. Epinephrine treatment may not always yield the expected therapeutic effect.</li><br>
                                <li>- General anaesthesia: In patients undergoing general anaesthesia the anaesthetist must be aware of beta-blockade. If it is thought necessary to withdraw Concor Plus before surgery, this should be done gradually and completed about 48 hours prior to anaesthesia.</li><br>
                                <li>- Phaeochromocytoma: In patients with a tumour of the adrenal gland (phaeochromocytoma) Concor Plus may only be administered after previous alpha-receptor blockade.</li><br>
                                <li>- Thyrotoxicosis: Under treatment with Concor Plus the symptoms of a thyroid hyperfunction (thyrotoxicosis) may be masked.</li><br>
                                <li>- Photosensitivity reactions may occur with thiazide diuretics. If photosensitivity reactions occur, it is recommended to protect exposed areas to the sun or to artificial UVA light. In severe cases it may be necessary to stop the treatment.</li><br>
                                <li>- Long-term, continuous administration of hydrochlorothiazide may lead to fluid and electrolyte disturbances, in particular to hypokalaemia and hyponatraemia, also to hypomagnesaemia and hypochloraemia, and hypercalcaemia. Hypokalaemia facilitates the development of severe arrhythmias, particularly torsade de pointes, which may be fatal.</li><br>
                                <li>During long term-therapy with hydrochlorothiazide, monitoring of serum electrolytes (especially potassium, sodium, calcium), creatinine and urea, the serum lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides), uric acid as well as blood glucose is recommended.</li><br>
                                <li>Hydrochlorothiazide, a sulfonamide, can cause an idiosyncratic reaction, resulting in acute transient myopia and acute angle-closure glaucoma. Symptoms include acute onset of decreased visual acuity or ocular pain and typically occur within hours to weeks of drug initiation. Untreated acute angle-closure glaucoma can lead to permanent vision loss. The primary treatment is to discontinue hydrochlorothiazide as rapidly as possible. Prompt medical or surgical treatments may need to be considered if the intraocular pressure remains uncontrolled. Risk factors for developing acute angle-closure glaucoma may include a history of sulfonamide or penicillin allergy.</li><br>
                            </ul>

                            <ul>
                                <li>- Concor Plus is not recommended during pregnancy. Diuretics may give rise to foetoplacental ischaemia with the attendant risk of foetal hypotrophy. Hydrochlorothiazide is suspected to cause thrombocytopenia in the neonate.</li><br>
                                <li>- Concor Plus is not recommended in breastfeeding women, because bisoprolol may be and hydrochlorothiazide is excreted in breast milk in minimal amounts. Hydrochlorothiazide can inhibit the milk production.</li><br>
                            </ul>
                            <h5>Fertility:</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li>- No human data on fertility are known for the combination product. Bisoprolol or hydrochlorothiazide had no influence on fertility or on general reproduction performance in animal studies.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h5>Effects On The Ability To Drive And Use Machines:</h5>
                            <ul>
                                <li>- In general Concor Plus has no or neglible influence on the
                                    ability to drive and use machines. However, depending on the
                                    individual patients
                                    dev.cat.mahmoudelbaz.heartgate.signUp.LiveRsponse to treatment
                                    the ability to drive a vehicle or to use machines may be
                                    impaired. This needs to be considered particularly at start of
                                    treatment, upon change of medication, or in conjunction with
                                    alcohol.</li><br>
