                            <h4>Concor Plus must not be used in patients with:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>- Acute heart failure or during episodes of heart failure decompensation requiring intravenous therapy with substances increasing the contractility of the heart</li><br>

                                <li>- Untreated phaeochromocytoma (a rare tumor of the adrenal gland),</li><br>
                                <li>- Metabolic acidosis (increase of blood acidity as a result of severe illness)</li><br>
                                <li>- Severe kidney impairment (creatinine clearance  30 mL/min)</li><br>

                                <li>- Refractory hypokalaemia (low blood levels of potassium, not responding to treatment)</li><br>
                                <li>- Severe hyponatraemia (very low blood levels of sodium)</li><br>
                                <li>- Hypercalcaemia (high blood levels of calcium)</li><br>

                            </ul>
                            <h4>Interactions:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>- The effect and tolerability of medicines can be influenced by simultaneous intake of other medication. Such interactions can also occur if a short time has elapsed since the use of the other medication. Please tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including medicines obtained without a prescription.</li><br>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>Combinations not recommended:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>- Lithium has a cardiotoxic and neurotoxic effect. This effect may be intensified through hydrochlorothiazide because it may lead to a reduction of lithium excretion. </li><br>
                                <li>- Calcium antagonists of the verapamil type and to a lesser extent of the diltiazem type may lead to reduced contractility of the heart muscle and delayed atrio-ventricular impulse conduction when used concomitantly with bisoprolol. Especially intravenous administration of verapamil in patients on ß-blocker treatment may lead to profound hypotension and atrioventricular block.</li><br>
                                <li>- Centrally acting blood pressure-lowering medicines (such as clonidine, methyldopa, moxonodine, rilmenidine) may lead to a reduction of heart rate and cardiac output, as well as to vasodilation due to a decrease in the central sympathetic tonus. However do not stop taking these medicines without checking with your doctor first. This is because abrupt withdrawal, particularly if prior to beta-blocker discontinuation, may increase risk of “rebound hypertension”.</li><br>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>Combinations to be used with caution:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>- Calcium antagonists of the dihydropyridine type (e.g. nifedipine) may increase the risk of hypotension when used concomitantly with bisoprolol. An increased risk of a further deterioration of the ventricular pump function in patients with heart failure cannot be excluded.</li><br>
                                <li>- Class-I antiarrhythmic medicines (e.g. quinidine, disopyramide, lidocaine, phenytoin; flecainide, propafenone) may increase the depressant effect of bisoprolol on atrio-ventricular impulse conduction and the contractility of the heart.</li><br>
                                <li>- ACE inhibitors (e.g. captopril, enalapril) or angiotensin II antagonists bear the risk of significant fall in blood pressure and/or acute renal failure during initiation of ACE inhibitor therapy in patients with pre-existing sodium depletion (particularly in patients with renal artery stenosis).</li><br>
                                <li>- If prior diuretic therapy has produced sodium depletion, your doctor will either stop the diuretic 3 days before starting ACE inhibitor therapy, or initiate ACE inhibitor therapy at a low dose.</li><br>
                                <li>- Topical ß-blockers (e.g. eye drops for glaucoma treatment) may add to the systemic effects of bisoprolol.</li><br>
                                <li> Topical ß-blockers (e.g. eye drops for glaucoma treatment) may add to the systemic effects of bisoprolol.</li><br>
                                <li>- The blood sugar lowering effect of insulin or oral antidiabetic medicines may be intensified. Warning signs of reduced blood glucose (hypoglycaemia) – especially accelerated heart rate (tachycardia)- may be masked or suppressed. Such interactions are considered to be more likely with nonselective -blockers.</li><br>
                                <li>- Anaesthetic agents may increase the risk of cardiodepressive actions of bisoprolol, leading to hypotension (for further information on general anaesthesia see also section special warnings and precautions)</li>
                                <li>- Antiarrhythmic agents that may induce torsades de pointes (Class IA e.g. quinidine, hydroquinidine, disopyramide, and Class III e.g. amiodarone, sotalol, dofetilide, ibutilide): Hypokalaemia may facilitate the occurrence of torsades de pointes.</li><br>
                                <li>- Nonantiarrhythmic agents that may induce torsades de pointes (e.g. astemizole, i.v. erythromycin, halofantrine, pentamidine, sparfloxacin, terfenadine, vincamine.): Hypokalaemia may facilitate the occurrence of torsades de pointes.</li><br>
                                <li>- Cardiac glycosides (digitalis) may lead to an increase in impulse conduction time and thus reduction in heart rate when used concomitantly with bisoprolol.</li><br>
                                <li>- Toxic effects of cardiac glycosides (digitalis) may be facilitated if hydrochlorothiazide leads to hypokalaemia.</li><br>
                                <li>- Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) may reduce the blood pressure-lowering effect of Concor Plus. They also can trigger acute renal failure in patients developing hypovolaemia..</li><br>
                                <li>- Sympathomimetics (e.g. isoprenaline, dobutamine) used in combination with bisoprolol may lead to a reduced effect of both agents.</li><br>
                                <li>- A combination of bisoprolol with sympathomimetics that activate both - and -adrenoceptors (e.g. noradrenaline, adrenaline) may intensify the -adrenoceptor-mediated vasoconstrictor effects of these agents leading to blood pressure increase. Such interactions are considered to be more likely with nonselective -blockers.</li><br>
                                <li>- Antihypertensive agents as well as other medicines with blood pressure lowering potential (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, barbiturates, phenothiazines) may increase the blood pressure lowering effect of Concor Plus.</li><br>
                                <li>- Potassium-wasting medicinal products (e.g. corticosteroids, ACTH, carbenoxolone, amphotericin B, furosemide, or laxatives) may result in increased potassium losses when used concomitantly with hydrochlorothiazide.</li><br>
                                <li>- Methyldopa has been described in isolated cases to lead to haemolysis due to the formation of antibodies to hydrochlorothiazide.</li><br>
                                <li>- The effect of uric-acid-lowering agents may be attenuated in concomitant administration of hydrochlorothiazide. </li><br>
                                <li>- Cholestyramine and colestipol reduce the absorption of the hydrochlorothiazide.</li><br>
                            </ul>
                            <h4>Combinations to be considered</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li>- Mefloquine may increase the risk of decelerating the heart rate (bradycardia), if used in combination with bisoprolol.</li><br>
                                <li> Corticosteroids may reduce the antihypertensive effect due to corticosteroid-induced water and sodium retention.</li>
