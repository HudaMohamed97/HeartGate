                            <h3>Mechanism Of Action / Pharmacodynamics:</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>- Bisoprolol is a selective β1-receptor blocker and has neither intrinsic sympathomimetic nor relevant membrane-stabilizing properties. This high affinity for β1-receptors is accompanied by low affinity for β2-receptors in the smooth muscle of the bronchi and vessels as well as the β2-receptors involved in metabolic regulation. For this reason, bisoprolol is not expected to have an effect on airway resistance or β2-dependent metabolism in patients with heart failure, at least at low doses. Its β1-selectivity is maintained over the entire therapeutic dose range. Bisoprolol has no negative inotropic effects during long-term use.</li><br>
                                <li>- The selective blockade of β1-receptors and the sympathetic nervous system reduces cardiac output and lowers blood pressure.</li>
                                <li>- During long-term treatment, the initially elevated peripheral resistance falls. By blocking cardioselective β1-receptors, bisoprolol reduces responsiveness to adrenergic stimuli.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>Clinical Efficacy:</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>- Clinical studies of heart failure patients have shown that administration of bisoprolol in combination with a diuretic and an ACE inhibitor significantly reduces the mortality rate. Two heart failure studies (CIBIS I and CIBIS II), in which bisoprolol was administered in combination with diuretics and ACE inhibitors, showed that it had a beneficial effect on survival: while the 20% reduction in mortality seen in the first CIBIS study (n = 641 patients, of whom 320 took bisoprolol) was not significant, CIBIS II (n = 2647 patients, of whom 1327 took bisoprolol) showed a highly significant reduction in overall mortality in NYHA III/IV patients (11.8% of bisoprolol patients compared to 17.3% in the placebo group; relative reduction: 34%). There was also a clear decrease in cases of sudden cardiac death (3.6% compared to 6.3%; relative reduction: 44%) and the number of admissions to hospital because of worsening heart failure (12% compared to 17.6%; relative reduction: 36%). Finally, there was evidence of a significant improvement in cardiac function based on the NYHA classification.</li><br>
                                
                                <li>- The condition of the patients, who were assigned to only classes III and IV at baseline, improved so much during the study that 25.6% were in NYHA class II after 6 months. This figure rose to 32.3% after 12 months and 35.1% after 18 months. 1.7%, 2.8% and 3.3% were in NYHA class I after 6 months, 12 months and 18 months respectively. At 15%, the proportion of patients who stopped taking bisoprolol permanently was similar to that recorded for the placebo.</li><br>
                                
                                <li>- A study of 36 patients with coronary heart disease (but not chronic heart failure) showed that bisoprolol reduces the heart rate and rate-pressure product, thereby relieving the heart.</li><br>
                                
                                <li>- The CIBIS III study was conducted on 1010 patients aged 65 and over with mild to moderate chronic heart failure (NYHA classes II or III) and a left ventricular ejection fraction of ≤ 35%. The patients had not been treated with ACE inhibitors, β-blockers or angiotensin receptor blockers previously. This study compared the efficacy and safety of treatment starting with six months of bisoprolol (target dose 10 mg once daily), followed by additional administration of the ACE inhibitor enalapril (target dose 10 mg twice daily) for an additional 6-24 months, with those of treatment starting with enalapril, followed by additional administration of bisoprolol. There were 505 patients in each treatment group. The two treatment strategies were analyzed in a blinded fashion for both the combined primary endpoint - all-cause mortality or hospitalization - and the individual components. The intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis showed that a primary endpoint event occurred in 178 patients in the group that started with bisoprolol (35.2%) and in 186 patients in the group that started with enalapril (36.8%). Therefore, the efficacy of treatment that starts with bisoprolol and adds enalapril is comparable (non-inferior) to that of the same combination administered in reverse order. 65 of the patients who started with bisoprolol died and 73 of the patients who started with enalapril died (difference between the groups: p = 0.44).</li><br>
                                
                                <li>- 151 of the patients who started with bisoprolol were admitted to hospital and 157 of the patients who started with enalapril were admitted to hospital (p = 0.66). The number of serious adverse events and the total number of adverse events were similar between the two groups. An analysis of the data from the first year of the study showed a 31% reduction in all-cause mortality in the group that started with bisoprolol compared to the group that started with enalapril. This trend was not significant. The survival benefit in the group that started with bisoprolol is attributed mainly to a 46% reduction in the risk of sudden cardiac death (p = 0.049) in the first year of treatment.</li><br>
