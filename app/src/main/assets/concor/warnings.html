                            <h3>1. Warnings</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>- Patients with coronary heart disease should not stop taking Concor suddenly unless absolutely necessary, as this may lead to a temporary deterioration in their condition</li>
                                <li>- Treatment of stable chronic heart failure must commence with a titration phase (see Specific dosage guidelines).</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>2. Precautions:</h3>
                            <p>Bisoprolol must be used with caution in cases of:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>- Diabetes mellitus with large fluctuations in blood glucose: The risk of affecting carbohydrate metabolism or masking symptoms of hypoglycemia (tachycardia, palpitations or sweating) is lower with β1-receptor blockers than with non-selective β-receptor blockers. In spite of this, caution is advised.</li><br>
                                <li>- Strict fasting.</li><br>
                                <li>- Concomitant desensitization therapy: Like all β-blockers, bisoprolol may increase sensitivity to allergens, which can increase the severity of anaphylactic reactions. Treatment with adrenaline does not always have the desired effect.</li><br>
                                <li>- First degree AV block.</li><br>
                                <li>- Prinzmetal's angina.</li><br>
                                <li>- Peripheral arterial occlusive disease: The symptoms may intensify, particularly at the  start of treatment.</li><br>
                                <li>- Psoriasis or a history of psoriasis: β-blockers (e.g. bisoprolol) should not be used until a careful risk-benefit analysis has taken place.</li><br>
                                <li>- Thyrotoxicosis: The symptoms of thyrotoxicosis may be masked by bisoprolol.</li><br>
                                <li>- Anaesthesia: The anesthetist must be informed about treatment with Concor before anaesthesia is induced because of potential interactions with other medicinal products. If it is necessary to suspend the treatment, the dose should be reduced gradually and Concor withdrawn no later than 48 hours before anaesthesia is induced.</li><br>
                                <li>- chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD): Due to its relative β1-selectivity, Concor may be used with caution in patients with COPD if there are compelling clinical reasons for its use. In this case, the treatment with bisoprolol should be started at the lowest possible dose. Concomitant treatment with a bronchodilator should be administered.</li><br>
                                <li>- Bronchial asthma: Concomitant treatment with a bronchodilator should be administered. Occasionally, airway resistance may increase in patients with asthma, requiring an increase in the β2-agonist dose; in cases of severe bronchial asthma, Concor is contraindicated (see Contraindications).</li><br>
                                <li>- Phaeochromocytoma: Bisoprolol must not be administered until after α-receptor blockade.</li><br>
                                <li>- Essential hypertension or angina and heart failure.</li><br>
                                <li>- At the start of treatment with Concor for stable chronic heart failure, the patient must be monitored regularly (see Specific dosage guidelines).</li><br>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Concor should be used with caution in patients with heart failure who are also in one of the following clinical situations, as there is no therapeutic experience of these combinations:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>- Insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (type 1).</li>
                                <li>- Severely impaired kidney function.</li>
                                <li>- Severely impaired liver function.</li>
                                <li>- Restrictive cardiomyopathy.</li>
                                <li>- Congenital heart disease.</li>
                                <li>- Heart valve defects with hemodynamic effects.</li>
                                <li>- Myocardial infarction in the previous 3 months.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Ending the treatment:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li> Treatment with bisoprolol should not be withdrawn suddenly, as this may lead to temporary worsening of heart failure or, especially in patients with coronary heart disease, an acute deterioration in their condition. If it is necessary to withdraw the treatment, the dose should be reduced gradually (e.g. halved at weekly intervals).</li>
                            </ul>
