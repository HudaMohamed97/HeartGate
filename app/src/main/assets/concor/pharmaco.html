                        <div class="content">
                           <h3>Absorption</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li> Bisoprolol is rapidly and almost completely (> 90%) absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and has only a small first-pass effect (&lt;10%). Plasma levels peak approx. 2-3 hours after oral administration. Bioavailability is high (approx. 90%) and does not depend on food intake. Kinetics are linear in a dose range from 5-20 mg.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>Distribution</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li> Plasma protein binding of bisoprolol is approximately 30%. </li>
                                <li>As a moderately lipophilic substance with a partition coefficient of 4.8, bisoprolol has a moderate volume of distribution with low plasma protein binding. After intravenous administration of bisoprolol, the volume of distribution was measured as 3.2 ± 0.2 l/kg BW. This shows that the pharmacokinetics of bisoprolol are independent of protein binding. Pharmacokinetic interactions with other medicinal products based on displacement from plasma protein binding sites are unlikely.</li>
                                <li>Bisoprolol penetrates the blood-brain barrier and cerebrospinal fluid levels are assumed to be  similar to free unbound plasma levels. It can be concluded from animal studies that accumulation of bisoprolol in the CNS is low compared to accumulation in plasma (factor of 2). Only small amounts of bisoprolol penetrate the placental barrier in animals. As a result, f oetal concentrations are lower than maternal plasma concentrations. The excretion of bisoprolol into the milk of breastfeeding women has not yet been determined directly. In an animal study, no more than 2% of a dose was found in milk.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>Metabolism</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Bisoprolol is eliminated by two routes (liver and kidneys) equally. 50% is converted to inactive metabolites in the liver, which are then excreted by the kidneys.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>Elimination</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li> The remaining 50% is excreted by the kidneys as unchanged drug. The mean plasma elimination half-life of bisoprolol is 10-12 hours.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <h3>Kinetics In Special Patient Populations</h3>
                            <ul>
                                <li> In patients with kidney failure, the elimination half-life of bisoprolol was increased by a factor of no more than 2. The same was found for patients with cirrhosis of the liver of varying severity. Adjustment of the bisoprolol dose is therefore only advisable for patients with end-stage kidney (creatinine clearance &lt;	20 ml/min) or liver failure. For these patients, a daily dose of 10 mg should not be exceeded.</li>
                                <li>For patients with heart failure, no pharmacokinetic data are available.</li>
                            </ul>
